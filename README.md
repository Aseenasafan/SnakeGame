# SnakeGame
## 📄 Project Description:
This is a classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript functions, asynchronous operations, and the HTML5 Canvas API to create smooth animations and gameplay.
## 🎮 Game Rules:
•	The snake must eat the food (red square) to grow in size and increase the score.
•	The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.
•	The score increases based on the number of food items eaten.
•	Press the Spacebar to pause or resume the game.
## 💡 Key Features:
•	Interactive canvas-based gameplay.
•	Real-time movement and collision detection.
•	Pause and resume functionality.
•	Score tracking based on food consumption.
•	Snake grows in size after each food item is eaten.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
•	HTML: Game structure and layout.
•	CSS: Game styling and design.
•	JavaScript: Game logic, asynchronous game loop, and user interactions.
•	Canvas API: Drawing the snake, food, and game area.
## 🚀 Concepts Applied:
•	Asynchronous JavaScript: Smooth and non-blocking game updates.
•	Functions: Modular and reusable game logic.
•	Canvas Manipulation: Rendering shapes and animations.
•	Event Handling: Keyboard input for controlling the snake and pausing the game.
